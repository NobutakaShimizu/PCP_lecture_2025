   abstract = {<p>Graph clustering is a fundamental computational problem with a number of applications in algorithm design, machine learning, data mining, and analysis of social networks. Over the past decades, researchers have proposed a number of algorithmic design methods for graph clustering. Most of these methods, however, are based on complicated spectral techniques or convex optimisation and cannot be directly applied for clustering many networks that occur in practice, whose information is often collected on different sites. Designing a simple and distributed clustering algorithm is of great interest and has comprehensive applications for processing big datasets.</p>},

Although our proof works using a type of density increment argument (which is typical of most proofs of Roth's theorem), we do not pass to a progression related to the large Fourier coefficients of our set (as most other proofs of Roth do). Furthermore, in our proof, the density increment is achieved through an application of a quantitative version of Varnavides's theorem, which is perhaps unexpected.]},

   abstract = {<p> The classical zero-one law for first-order logic on random graphs says that for every first-order property œÜ in the theory of graphs and every <italic>p</italic> ‚àà (0,1), the probability that the random graph <italic>G</italic> ( <italic>n</italic> , <italic>p</italic> ) satisfies œÜ approaches either 0 or 1 as <italic>n</italic> approaches infinity. It is well known that this law fails to hold for any formalism that can express the parity quantifier: for certain properties, the probability that <italic>G</italic> ( <italic>n</italic> , <italic>p</italic> ) satisfies the property need not converge, and for others the limit may be strictly between 0 and 1. </p>},

   abstract = {<p>The term distributed system typically refers to a set of entities, called nodes, connected by point-topoint communication links. The set of nodes together with the set of links form a network, which is usually represented by a graph. The term ?system" is used to reflect the fact that nodes evolve over time, i.e., they change their internal states according to some local interaction-rule, which is applied in every time step (i.e. round).</p>},
